This is a repository of formally verified competitive programming code. Formal verification is very important.

The problemsetters of this round accidentally made an NP-complete problem, and wrote a wrong greedy solution for it. The testers of this round guessed the same incorrect solution. The mistake was not caught during the review and testing phase. In the actual round, many folks also guessed the same incorrect solution. But a few smart folks proved the problem was NP-complete.

The problemsetters even wrote [an incorrect proof](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/111737?#comment-996084) for the greedy solution. Community members said the proof doesn't make sense.

This mistake could have been avoided entirely if the folks responsible for the round had used formal verification. I'm learning it. Will you join me?
