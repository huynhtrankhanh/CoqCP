# WebAssembly
If we want to formalize real-world programs in Coq, we need to have a way to represent them in a formal language that Coq can understand. WebAssembly provides a natural way to do this, as it is a well-defined bytecode format with a formal specification that can be used to encode a wide range of programs.

style A stroke:#EFA00B, stroke-width:2px;
style B stroke:#228B22, stroke-width:2px;
style C stroke:#1E90FF, stroke-width:2px;
style D stroke:#B22222, stroke-width:2px;
```

With the power of WebAssembly, you can tackle even the toughest problems.

## Workflow
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Write WebAssembly source code] --> B[Formalize and check correctness in Coq];
  B --> C[Compile WebAssembly to machine assembly that the judge can run];
  C --> D[Wrap the assembly in an inline asm statement in C++];
  D --> E[Submit the wrapped code];
```

**Task:** Formalize WebAssembly now
